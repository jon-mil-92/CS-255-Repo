## DriverPass Retrospective

> *Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?*

The DriverPass project was created to give customers an easy online interface for learning how to drive. This system is a web-based application that is hosted in a cloud-based environment. The DriverPass system could be accessed through many popular web browsers on many different devices. This would give customers a wide range of options to access DriverPass so that they can comfortably and conveniently learn how to drive. 
  
This system also has a physical aspect such that students could create reservations for on-the-road driver training. The system would automatically match students and drivers based on the provided information, and then the driver would pickup and drop off the student and upload driver comments to the DriverPass system. The system was also always kept up-to-date with the latest policies and rules straight from the DMV. This allowed students to gain access to classes and practice tests within the DriverPass system to teach them how to properly drive a motorized vehicle.

> *What did you do particularly well?*

I believe that the DriverPass system was extensively and comprehensively documented document through various documents and modeling techniques. The business requirements documents comprehensively detailed the purpose, goals, and business requirements of the DriverPass system. The nonfunctional and functional requirements were concise and descriptive, the user interface was descriptively laid out in organized sections, and many assumptions and limitations were described.

The DriverPass system was also modeled well in the system design document. I included detailed functional, object, and behavioral models using UML to fully describe many aspects of the DriverPass system. The technical requirements were laid out in this document so that the developers would know what tools to use, what platforms and devices their system should target, and the infrasture of the system.
  
> *If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?*

If I were to improve any part of these documents, it would have to be the UML diagrams. I had left out an ActivityReport class in my UML class diagram, and I could have consolidated some of the users into more specific clases such as an Employee class and a Customer class. These changes could have increased the readability of the diagrams that I created.
  
> *How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?*

The user's needs were interpreted from the requirements that were gathered during the DriverPass interview. Notes were taken during the interview so that all required functionality could be documented in the business requirements and system design documents. It is important to consider the user's needs during the analysis and design phases of the SDLC so that less maintenance would be needed after the initial implementation of the system is completed. By incorporating all of the required functionality from the get-go, less time and resources would be spent later on in development to add the missing functionality.

> *How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?*

Designing software starts with the requirements gathering process. This could be done through interviews, surveys, and so on. I would utilize Gantt charts and milestones to help guide the process and give the developers an idea of the project roadmap. I would also utilize process, object, and behavioral models to gain a complete understanding of the design of the system. It would also be important to understand the technical requirements of the system beforehand so that the system could be designed accordingly.
